ABOUT THE FILES
data.h - our main header file. this has all functions that we use across the different .c files and lots of definitions
main.c - the main running program.
pre_asm.c - handles the pre assembler part of the project
asm_part1.c - handles the first run of the assembler
asm_part2.c - handles the second run of the assembler

handle_instructions1.c - handles everything to do with the instructions for the *first* run
handle_instructions2.c - handles everything to do with the instructions for the *second* run

handle_commands1.c - handles everything to do with the commands for the *first* run
handle_commands2.c - handles everything to do with the commands for the *second* run

utils.c and base_trans.c are both files with useful functions used throughout the project
structs folder has our main struct, the dictionary.c and dictionary.h files


HOW TO RUN:
after using "make"
simply type "./main testFile1 testFile2 ..."

TESTERS:
our program has 3 main test files that should work. named testFile1 testFile2 and testFile3.
testFile1 is a bunch of commands and instructions together that should work but have no logic behind it
testFile2 is exactly the same as the examle in the mmn instructions
testFile3 is version of testFile2 but with macros

we also have testFile4 which has a bunch of errors that we found and handled throughout the code


Have fun checking the project, we put a lot of work and time into it ^.^
(there's also some easter eggs to find here)
